To solve the problem do the following:
1 Use Ghidra to decompile and analize the program
See there is a random value that is added with 0x539 = 1337(10)
The random value is stored in the rax addres
2. First run the program using valgrind
Then type start
Then enter ni for the program to proceed till you hit the second random and generate the number
Then press i r(displays the current content of cpu registers)
Copy decimal the value from rax(if your gdb can only see hex convert it to dec using python) and then to that value add 1337
3. Enter continue and hit enter, then introduce the number obtained and your program will say t is the correct number and spit out a youtube link also
